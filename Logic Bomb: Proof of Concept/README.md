I worked so hard on the IEEE report, that I would just let you open that one and read it. Convert it to markdown (md) is TOO much as it will never convert it properly. Furthermore, there's NO WAY I put that much work so people can see it nicely in a .md . Funny when I say "people", like anybody will ever read this lol
