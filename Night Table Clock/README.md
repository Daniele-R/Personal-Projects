# A pretty cool clock
It started as a father & son project so we both could learn along the way. I had to drop it at the middle of it with simple libraries implementation so I could understand the basics of it. What you will be seeing here is the code I partake/understood. My father later did the 3d printings and everything in between. Not a full project of mine, but it was with what I started with.

I wish my high school back then had some coding classes so I could've participate more in this. Picture attached of the current clock.
