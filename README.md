# Personal-Projects
Fun projects that I thought of. Whatever you might see in here, is 100% mine, but you are free to use it as you will w/o s/o me :)

## Project #1 - GPT API for HW
A Python script that reads the screen, ask OpenAI API for the correct response, and then selects the right answer for a multiple choice questionnaire. Pretty much a make-your-homework tool.

## Project #2 - Logic Bomb | A proof of concept
Another Python script that utilizes different libraries. Long story short, it is a pretty cool script that stays hiddent to corrupt a targeted file when conditions are met. Read the report for further understanding.
