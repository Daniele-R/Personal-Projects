# Personal-Projects
Fun projects that I thought of. Whatever you might see in here, is 100% mine, but you are free to use it as you will w/o s/o me :)

## Project 0 - Night-Table Clock
3D printed clock with multiple Raspberry Pi (prev. Arduino) implementations such as weather reading, moving sensor, action button, power chord, Wi-Fi access, etc. A project my father and I did when I was ~15.

## Project #1 - GPT API for HW
A Python script that reads the screen, ask OpenAI API for the correct response, and then selects the right answer for a multiple choice questionnaire. Pretty much a make-your-homework tool.

## Project #2 - Logic Bomb | A proof of concept
Another Python script that utilizes different libraries. Long story short, it is a pretty cool script that stays hiddent to corrupt a targeted file when conditions are met. Read the report for further understanding.

## Project #3 - IoC Scrapper
Once again, Python comes through with the ability of using multiple of their libraries to create a simple UI-based application that generates a list of IoC (Indicators of Compromise) ready to implement into whichever system in place for IoC tracking.

## Project #4 - F0 & ESP32 BT Jammer
TBD - I already finished it a while ago, but I created a small BT disruptor with FlipperZero and an ESP32. Nothing crazy, but the fact I could escalate it with a couple of hardware pieces into a cyber-warfare tool is crazy to me. Obviously for research purposes only! Pretty cool regardless. Once I decide to post it here, I will just post it. Right now Im too busy grinding CPTS. Might include the project here once Im done with that, and post my notes in here as well. We ball baby
