# GPT API Utilization - HW automation?

## Goal
This script focuses on having a side by side script that will automate the GPT responses. The objective is to cut the process of copy-pasting, manual screenshots, and once completed, automate the manual selection of multiple choice questions.

## How to use

### Part 1 (With IDE)
This part of the code takes the screenshot, reads it, sends it to the API, and pushes an answer that will be displayed in at GUI. Photo below for demostration

### Part 2 (With IDE)
This part of the code does the same as part 1, but it implements the user automation of selecting the right answer and proceeding. Photo below for final result

## Part 3 (.exe)
Simply download the application (GPTread.exe) and use it. Keep it mind it requires the first chrome tab to be the one being read, and you must have actual EYE CONTACT with the screen/target as that would be the screenshot taken. Think it this way, the script is simply seeing exactly what you seeing, so you must have in display what you want to be targeted. Just play with it until it works haha
