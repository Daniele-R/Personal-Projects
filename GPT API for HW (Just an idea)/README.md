# GPT API Utilization - HW automation?

## Goal
This script focuses on having a side by side script that will automate the GPT responses. The objective is to cut the process of copy-pasting, manual screenshots, and once completed, automate the manual selection of multiple choice questions.

## How to use

### Part 1
This part of the code takes the screenshot, reads it, sends it to the API, and pushes an answer that will be displayed in at GUI. Photo below for demostration
